# Current Project-Lead Status

Verified: 2026-07-21 00:47 PDT

## Overall state

The project is active and materially progressing. The current worker remains
suitable as the primary implementation owner. Earlier excessive test expansion
has been corrected by steering; recent work uses bounded kill gates and removes
slower candidates.

- Current work: design and implement the smallest default-off worker-local RPC
  state protocol, then qualify one disposable two-rank restore canary

## Product progress

- L10c is the first normal-completion, client-handle-free default-off server
  canary to demonstrate authenticated exact-key cold miss, prompt-boundary
  publication, process restart, and hit. The tiny-model proof reduced prompt
  processing from 11 tokens cold to 1 restored token with exact continuation.
- A changed prompt recomputed cold without replacing the original entry;
  reserve exhaustion published nothing; corrupt/incompatible state remains a
  cold fallback. This remains a single-entry generation-one laboratory canary,
  not production persistence or a 160 GB model cache-state workload.
- L10a now authenticates the fixed generation-one anchor and automatically
  derives its selected manifest without trusting directory names. Publish,
  reopen, automatic selection, exact restore, wrong-scope miss, and
  corrupted-anchor miss passed on nimo-2. Server runtime lookup/writeback is the
  current next gate rather than a completed claim.
- L10b derives an opaque authenticated checkpoint lineage from private scope,
  closed compatibility, exact fixed-width canonical tokens, and bounded target
  topology/profile. Focused and inherited controls passed on nimo-2, and the
  ordinary server binary contained no exact-session marker. This is committed
  as `d7950c43`; it still has no normal request/runtime behavior by itself.
- L10c passed 7/7 focused tests in both gate-on and gate-off builds. Thirty
  balanced tiny-model feature-off pairs had identical outputs and non-worse
  point estimates (+2.35% prompt, +0.75% paired generation), but the broad
  confidence intervals mean this is not final G9/G10 evidence.
- L10d adds a fixed authenticated catalog of two to eight independent immutable
  generation-one entries while partitioning the existing quota. Two prompts
  each processed 11 tokens cold and 1 after restart; a third prompt at capacity
  processed cold without tree mutation. Focused Linux tests passed 8/8,
  independent review accepted the repaired authority, and production remained
  active with zero restarts. Commit `6862ffb9` is clean.
- L11 proves the current sequence serializer is globally complete only by
  transferring worker-resident KV pages through RPC: four GET payloads totaling
  41,472 bytes during capture and four SET payloads totaling 41,472 bytes during
  restore for the small fixture. The worker has no rank-local serializer,
  persistent writer, readiness authority, or commit-live participant. The
  reviewed documentation-only blocker is committed cleanly as `78a102ac`.
- The exact 160 GB primary model is pinned and repeatedly benchmarked.

## Performance truth

- Matched feature-off baseline is roughly 203.8 prompt tokens/s and 16.65
  generation tokens/s for the exact primary workload.
- No accepted full-model speedup exists yet.
- Several rank-local/fused/placement candidates were correctly rejected and
  removed after 0.3–4.3% matched slowdowns.
- Profiling shows alternating rank work and roughly half-duty GPUs; aggregate
  USB4 bandwidth is not the present limiting resource.
- The P13 private MMVQ micro-canary is correct and locally faster, but its
  estimated full-token contribution is only about 0.1%. It was retained as a
  default-off exact-shape proof at `ea49690a` and its product integration lane
  was correctly closed rather than overstated.
- P14 RPC row split preserved exact output but changed prompt throughput by only
  about +0.046% and generation by about -0.092%. It was correctly rejected and
  committed at `522dd90c`; production recovered to HTTP 200 with zero restarts.

## Lead decision

L11 is accepted as a real architecture blocker, not a project stop. A fresh
primary worker now owns the separately approved protocol phase: add worker-
local immutable tensor persistence and bounded authenticated readiness/commit
messages without state payloads on the control plane. The first proof remains a
small disposable two-host fixture. Any failure must discard the attempt and
cold-recompute from a clean context. The 160 GB model, eviction, production
enablement, and broad fault work remain closed until that reviewed canary.
